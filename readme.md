# spotify-qt-quick
This repo contains the Qt Quick user interface for [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt). 
It's mostly intended for use with mobile devices, but can be used with desktop devices as well.

**NOTE:** This application is currently being re-written from the ground up, so a lot of features 
will be missing or not working. If you need something now, use the latest "stable" version, or
use [spotify-qt](https://github.com/kraxarn/spotify-qt) instead.
